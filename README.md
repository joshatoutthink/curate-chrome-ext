# curate-chrome-ext

- this is different than pinterest, becuase its more streamlined with a single purpose, and is not for long running curation just immeadiate.
- Version 1: will just export a folder with images.
- Version 1: Just one bucket to screen shot images
- screenshot will automagically send that screenshot to the storage device
- right click image and send so storage device

##  Technology 
- AWS buckets
